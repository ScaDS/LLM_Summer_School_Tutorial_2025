# ScaDS.AI Summer School LLM Training

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks about basic and advanced LLM usage, focusing on what's practicslly possible with Large Language Models. We demonstrate most utilities using the [ScaDS.AI Large Language Models (LLM) Servicer](https://llm.scads.ai) ([TU Dresden VPN](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/dienste/service-katalog/arbeitsumgebung/zugang_datennetz/vpn) required). Most exercises should also work with other providers such as [GWDG KISSKI](https://kisski.gwdg.de/leistungen/2-02-llm-service/) and [Helmholtz Blablador](https://login.helmholtz.de/oauth2-as/oauth2-authz-web-ui). 
The tutorial aims at Python programmers who want to dive into LLMs for generating text, code and data using open source/weights models. After this course they will be able to integrate LLMs into their software applications.
