    "In this notebook we will access large language mocels hosted at the [ScaDS.AI LLM infrastructure](https://llm.scads.ai/) infrastructure of the [Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing (ZIH) of TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/zih). To use it, you must be connected via [TU Dresden VPN](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/dienste/service-katalog/arbeitsumgebung/zugang_datennetz/vpn). This method uses the [openai Python library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), and the OpenAI API. We just change the `base_url`.\n",

      "The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is one of humanity's oldest and most profound inquiries, with answers varying widely across philosophical, religious, scientific, and cultural perspectives. Here’s a synthesis of key viewpoints:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Religious/Spiritual Perspectives**:  \n",
      "   - Many religions propose that life’s purpose is tied to a divine plan. For example, Christianity emphasizes loving God and others, Buddhism focuses on ending suffering through enlightenment, and Islam highlights submission to Allah and righteous living.  \n",
      "   - Spirituality often centers on connection to a higher purpose, inner peace, or transcendence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Philosophical Views**:  \n",
      "   - **Existentialism** (e.g., Sartre, Camus): Life has no inherent meaning; individuals must create their own purpose through choices, passions, and actions.  \n",
      "   - **Utilitarianism**: Maximizing happiness and reducing suffering for the greatest number.  \n",
      "   - **Absurdism** (Camus): Embracing the tension between seeking meaning and a universe that offers none, finding freedom in the act of living fully regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Scientific Lens**:  \n",
      "   - Biology suggests life’s \"purpose\" may relate to survival, adaptation, and reproduction.  \n",
      "   - From a cosmic perspective, some argue meaning emerges from understanding our place in the universe through exploration and scientific inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cultural & Personal Values**:  \n",
      "   - Societies emphasize different ideals—community, creativity, knowledge, or legacy.  \n",
      "   - Individuals often derive meaning from relationships, personal growth, art, career, activism, or contributing to others’ well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Subjective Journey**:  \n",
      "   - Many find meaning in love, family, pursuing passions, or leaving a positive impact. Others see it as an ongoing quest rather than a fixed answer.  \n",
      "   - The search itself can be meaningful, fostering reflection, resilience, and connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, the meaning of life is not a universal answer but a deeply personal exploration. It may evolve over time, shaped by experiences, values, and the questions we ask. As Viktor Frankl wrote, \"Life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose.\" Ultimately, it’s a tapestry woven from the threads of choice, curiosity, and the connections we nurture.\n"
